- Before using the software, make sure your device is plugged in to a power source and has enough battery charge.
- Close all other programs and applications that are running on your device to avoid any interference or errors.
- If you want to create a backup copy of your entire system, including the operating system, drivers, applications, and personal files, use the Create Factory Default Backup option. This will create a recovery image that you can use to restore your system to its original state.
- If you only want to backup your personal files, such as documents, photos, videos, music, etc., use the Create User Backup option. This will create a backup file that you can store on an external drive or a cloud service.
- If you want to restore your system using a previously created backup image or file, use the Restore option. You can choose to restore your system to its factory default state or to a specific point in time.
- If you want to reinstall drivers or applications that came pre-installed on your device, use the Reinstall Drivers or Applications option. You can select the drivers or applications that you want to reinstall from a list.
