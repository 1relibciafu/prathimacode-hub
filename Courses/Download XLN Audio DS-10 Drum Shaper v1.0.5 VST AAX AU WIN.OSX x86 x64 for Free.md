## How to Use XLN Audio DS-10 Drum Shaper
 
Using XLN Audio DS-10 Drum Shaper is very easy and intuitive. You just need to load the plugin on your drum track or bus, and choose one of the three modes: Kick, Snare, or Bus. Each mode is specially tuned and optimized for the source you want to enhance. For example, Kick mode is designed for processing an isolated kick drum track or sample, while Bus mode is ideal for processing a stereo drum bus or a full drum mix.
 
Once you have selected the mode, you can use the Attack and Sustain knobs to adjust the volume of the transient and post-transient portions of the sound. For example, if you want to make your kick drum more punchy, you can increase the Attack and decrease the Sustain. If you want to make your snare drum more snappy, you can increase both the Attack and the Sustain.
 
You can also use the Mojo knob to fine-tune your sound with additional processing that is carefully adapted to each mode. For example, in Kick mode, the Mojo knob controls the Tightness parameter, which lets you go from a more boomy sound to a controlled tight punch or the other way around. In Snare mode, the Mojo knob controls the Body parameter, which lets you control the low mid frequencies of the snare drum. In Bus mode, the Mojo knob controls the Presence parameter, which lets you increase or decrease the high end of the drum mix.
