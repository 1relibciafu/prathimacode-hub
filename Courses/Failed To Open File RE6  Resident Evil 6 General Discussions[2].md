5. If the error persists, you can enable your antivirus again and try another solution.

## Solution 4: Uninstall Any Mods
 
If you have installed any mods for Resident Evil 6, they may also cause conflicts with the game files and trigger the error. To fix this, you can uninstall any mods that you have installed and see if that helps. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Resident Evil 6 installation folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\resident evil 6).
2. Delete any folders or files that are related to mods (such as nativePCnext or uPlTex0100\_0.arc).
3. Launch the game again and see if the error is gone.
4. If you want to use mods again, make sure they are compatible with your game version and install them one by one to identify which one causes the problem.
