The manuals are in PDF format and include an English and a French version. They cover the installation, features, panel description, systems operation, flight procedures, performance data and troubleshooting. They are well written and illustrated with screenshots and diagrams. They also provide some background information on the real A400M and its development history.
 
The paint kit is a PSD file that allows you to create your own liveries for the A400M using Photoshop or any other compatible image editor. It includes layers for the fuselage, wings, engines, tail and windows. You can also use the existing liveries as templates or reference. The add-on comes with 12 liveries representing different air forces and organizations that have ordered or operate the A400M: German Air Force, French Air Force, Camouflage, Spanish Air Force, Royal Air Force (green), Red Cross, Royal Air Force (grey), Belgian Air Force, French Air Force (dark), Turkish Air Force, Unicef and U.S.COAST GUARD.
 
The support files include a configuration tool that allows you to adjust some settings such as display options, sound volume, joystick sensitivity and realism options. You can also access the load manager from this tool. The load manager lets you select the cargo type and weight that you want to load on the A400M. You can choose from different categories such as pallets, containers, vehicles or helicopters. You can also specify the number of passengers and crew on board. The load manager will calculate the center of gravity and fuel consumption accordingly.
 
Once you have installed and configured the add-on, you can start your flight simulator and select the A400M from the aircraft menu. You will be greeted by a realistic cockpit with functional gauges, switches and displays. The 2D cockpit consists of six main panels: main panel, overhead panel, pedestal panel, MCDU panel, HUD panel and EFIS pop-up panel. You can access them by clicking on hotspots on the screen or using keyboard shortcuts. The 3D virtual cockpit is fully interactive and clickable. You can move around using your mouse or joystick hat switch. You can also zoom in or out using your mouse wheel or keyboard commands.
 
The cockpit instruments are based on the real A400M's avionics suite. They include a primary flight display (PFD), a navigation display (ND), an engine/warning display (EWD) and a system display (SD). The PFD shows the basic flight information such as attitude, airspeed, altitude, heading, vertical speed and flight mode annunciations. The ND shows the navigation information such as waypoints, routes, navaids and traffic. It has four modes: arc, rose,
