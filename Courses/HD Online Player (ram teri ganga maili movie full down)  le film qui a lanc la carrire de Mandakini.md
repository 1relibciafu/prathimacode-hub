Ram Teri Ganga Maili is considered to be Raj Kapoor's last masterpiece and a tribute to his love for cinema and India. The film showcases his signature style of blending realism and fantasy, social commentary and entertainment, tragedy and comedy. The film also features some of the most memorable songs composed by Ravindra Jain, such as "Ram Teri Ganga Maili Ho Gayi", "Ek Radha Ek Meera" and "Sun Sahiba Sun". The film's cinematography by Radhu Karmakar captures the beauty and diversity of India, from the snow-capped Himalayas to the crowded streets of Calcutta.
 
Ram Teri Ganga Maili also marked the debut of Mandakini, who became an overnight sensation for her bold and innocent portrayal of Ganga. She was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance. Rajiv Kapoor, Raj Kapoor's youngest son, played the role of Narendra and delivered a convincing performance as a conflicted lover. Divya Rana played the role of Radha, Narendra's childhood friend who loves him secretly and helps him reunite with Ganga.
 
Ram Teri Ganga Maili is not only a romantic saga but also a social drama that explores the themes of corruption, poverty, exploitation and pollution. The film uses the metaphor of Ganga, the pure and sacred river that becomes polluted and tainted by human greed and sin, to reflect the state of India in the post-independence era. The film also criticizes the hypocrisy and double standards of the urban elite who exploit the rural poor and disregard their culture and values. The film ends with a hopeful message that Ganga will regain its purity and glory someday, just like India will overcome its challenges and achieve its true potential.
