## Step 3: Scan the frequencies
 
Now, you can start scanning the frequencies by clicking on the "Scan" button. The software will scan all the digital channels in your area and show you the results in a table. You can see the frequency, channel number, signal strength, signal quality, and modulation type for each channel.
 
The signal strength is measured in dBmV (decibel-millivolts) and shows how strong the signal is. The higher the value, the better. The signal quality is measured in percentage and shows how clear the signal is. The higher the value, the better. You can also see a graphical representation of the signal strength and quality in a bar chart.
 
## Step 4: Find the best location and direction for your antenna
 
Finally, you can use the software to find the best location and direction for your antenna. You can do this by moving your antenna around and observing how the signal strength and quality change. You can also use a compass or a map to find out where the transmitter is located.
 
The best location for your antenna is where you get the highest signal strength and quality values for most of the channels that you want to watch. The best direction for your antenna is where you point it towards the transmitter or as close as possible.
 
You can also use the software to fine-tune your antenna by adjusting its height, angle, or polarity. You can save your scan results and compare them later.
