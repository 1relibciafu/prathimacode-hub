But what exactly is Orchester-Probespiel and why is it important for cellists? Orchester-Probespiel is a German term that means "orchestral audition". It refers to the process of selecting musicians for an orchestra, usually by having them play a short piece or a series of excerpts in front of a panel of judges. The excerpts are chosen to test the technical and musical skills of the candidates, as well as their ability to blend in with the orchestra.
 
Orchestral auditions are very competitive and demanding, as there are usually many applicants for a few positions. Therefore, cellists who want to pursue an orchestral career need to prepare well and practice diligently. They need to know the repertoire inside out, and be able to play with accuracy, expression and confidence. They also need to be familiar with the style and expectations of different orchestras and conductors.
