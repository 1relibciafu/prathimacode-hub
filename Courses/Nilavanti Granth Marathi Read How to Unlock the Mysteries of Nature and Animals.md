Nilavanti was the only daughter of a very rich man in a village. She was born with a special gift of understanding the language of ants and other animals.

One day, when she was sitting under a tree in her field, she heard a strange voice. She looked around and saw no one. Then she realized that it was coming from two ants who were talking to each other about how to protect their home from the upcoming rain. She was amazed and curious. She started talking to them and they taught her some mantras that could help her learn the language of other animals as well.
