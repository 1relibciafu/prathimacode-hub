RF and microwaves are fundamental technologies in numerous industrial and commercial applications, such as wireless communications, Direct Broadcast TV, Global Positioning System (GPS), healthcare, and many others. In this book, Matthew M. Radmanesh, a seasoned RF and microwave engineer with over 30 years of experience in the field, provides a comprehensive and practical guide to the design of RF and microwave circuits using state-of-the-art tools and techniques.
 
The book covers a wide range of topics, from the basics of wave propagation and transmission lines, to the advanced topics of network analysis, stability, gain, noise, amplifiers, oscillators, frequency converters, control circuits, and microwave integrated circuits (MICs). The book also introduces a series of scientific postulates and axioms that lay the foundation for any of the engineering sciences and are unique to this book compared with similar RF and microwave texts. The book is richly illustrated with many examples and exercises that help the reader master the concepts and apply them to real-world problems.
