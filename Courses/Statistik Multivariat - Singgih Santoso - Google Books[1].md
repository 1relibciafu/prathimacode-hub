One of the main topics of the book is factor analysis, which is a technique to reduce the dimensionality of a large set of variables by identifying the underlying factors that explain the common variance among them. The book explains the types of factor analysis, such as exploratory and confirmatory, and the methods of factor extraction, such as principal component analysis and maximum likelihood. The book also discusses the criteria for determining the number of factors, such as eigenvalues, scree plot, and parallel analysis. The book shows how to perform factor analysis using SPSS and how to interpret the output, such as factor loadings, communalities, and factor scores.
 
Another topic of the book is cluster analysis, which is a technique to group similar objects into clusters based on their characteristics. The book describes the types of cluster analysis, such as hierarchical and non-hierarchical, and the methods of cluster formation, such as single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, and k-means. The book also explains the criteria for choosing the optimal number of clusters, such as dendrogram, elbow method, and silhouette coefficient. The book demonstrates how to perform cluster analysis using SPSS and how to interpret the output, such as cluster membership, cluster centroids, and cluster profiles.
 
A third topic of the book is discriminant analysis, which is a technique to classify objects into predefined groups based on their features. The book outlines the types of discriminant analysis, such as linear and quadratic, and the assumptions and conditions for applying them. The book also covers the methods of discriminant function estimation, such as Fisher's method and stepwise method. The book illustrates how to perform discriminant analysis using SPSS and how to interpret the output, such as discriminant functions, canonical correlation, classification matrix, and hit ratio.
